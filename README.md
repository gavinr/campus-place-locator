# campus-place-locator

***The Campus Place Locator replaces the [Campus Place Finder application](https://github.com/Esri/campus-place-finder)***

Campus Place Locator is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that offers a map-based view of interior and exterior assets on a university or business campus.

* Try the [Campus Place Locator application](http://links.esri.com/localgovernment/tryit/CampusPlaceLocator/)

## Features

* Search for an employee by name, or building space
* Use the map and floor navigator to find an area of interest.

## Requirements

**Start now using Esri-supplied sample services**

You can start using the application now by setting it up on a web server running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and using sample services supplied by Esri.
You'll need to convert to an application in IIS and use the ASP .NET 4.0 or 4.5. application pool.

**Start now using your own services**

For more information on requirements and publication steps, see [Campus Place Locator](http://links.esri.com/localgovernment/help/campusplacelocator) help

## Resources

Show me a list of other [Local Government GitHub repositories](http://esri.github.io/#Local-Government).

Additional [information and sample data](http://links.esri.com/localgovernment/help/campusplacelocato)
are available for the application.

This application uses the 3.14 version of
[Esri's ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/);
see the site for concepts, samples, and a reference for using the API to create mapping web sites.
